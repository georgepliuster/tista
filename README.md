////// NOTES FOR SUNIL /////////////////
SUNIL.

I got the first problem to work, but could not 'import' nor 'require' the fake-db.js file.  I put notes in the code, showing what needed to be done to handle the duplicate email issue.  Look for the pattern 'gpl' or 'GPL' in the code, for any new code I added.

Thanks,
George
